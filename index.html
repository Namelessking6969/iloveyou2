                        we were together.
                        The love, the passion, the everything about it was perfect, i knew she would be my soul mate and

        <p style="color: white;"><b>When i feel down, when i feel like nothing else matters, i look at her and realize life is worth living, life is worth everything..She keeps me on my toes, she keeps me sane, she keeps me looking at life from different angles, she is more then everything that i ever wanted, she is more then everything i have ever needed, she is my world, she is the other piece of my heart </b></p>

        <p style="color: white;"><b>I love her more then anything in this world, her and my kids saved me, They made my life better and made me see what family really was</b></p>

        <p style="color:white;"><b>When i first met her, she made an impact on me that most people can't do, they can't leave me wondering if they are happy, they can't leave me wondering if i made an impact in their life, they can't leave me wondering if i am an imortant person to them, But when i first met her, i couldn't tell if i made an impact, if i made her happy...Over the years we have been together i realize i made a good impact in her life...She tells me everyday that i mean something to her, she tells me i am everything to her, she tells me that everything is perfect, so to me she is everything, she is my only happiness, she is my world, my breath, i can't see her not in my life, i can't see myself without her next to me...</b></p>

        <p style="color: white;"><b>When i walked into her life it was like everything went perfectly for me, it was like my life became perfect and my world became complete.</b></p>
